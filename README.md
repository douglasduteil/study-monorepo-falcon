## Aim

- Architecture with multiple target
  - [ ] No dependencies target
  - [ ] One inner dependencies target
  - [ ] One inner dependencies target

- Build only what is needed
  - [ ] (might) add tooling to maintain dependency list in static files
  - [ ] (might) add tooling to maintain additional locks on actions
